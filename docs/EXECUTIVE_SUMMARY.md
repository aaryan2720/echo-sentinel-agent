## Recommended Tech Stack for Backend

### Quick Backend Setup (Hackathon Speed)
```
Language: Python (FastAPI) ‚Äî fastest for AI/ML integration
Database: PostgreSQL + MongoDB (Docker Compose)
Real-time: Socket.io or native WebSocket
AI/ML: Hugging Face APIs (no local models needed)
PDF: Puppeteer (Node.js) or ReportLab (Python)
Graph Viz: D3.js or React Flow (client-side)
Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
```

### Minimum Viable Backend (MVP)
```python
# 5 Critical Endpoints:
GET  /api/incidents       # List incidents
GET  /api/alerts          # List alerts  
GET  /api/agents          # Agent status
POST /api/analyze         # Upload & analyze media
WS   /ws                  # Real-time updates
```
