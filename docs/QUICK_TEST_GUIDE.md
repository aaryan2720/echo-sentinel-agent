## 🏆 Demo Checklist

For hackathon presentation:

- [ ] Test page loads without errors
- [ ] Image analysis completes in <10 seconds
- [ ] Results look professional (cards, badges, confidence)
- [ ] Logs show AI activity (builds trust)
- [ ] Can explain: "This uses Hugging Face AI model"

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Agent not running"
→ Refresh the page, it should auto-start

### "Analysis failed"
→ Check `.env` has `VITE_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY`

### "First request takes 30 seconds"
→ Normal! Model loads on first use. Second request is faster.

### "Image from X website fails"
→ CORS issue. Try Unsplash URLs instead.

### "Video stuck at 'Loading...'"
→ Expected. Videos are experimental. Stick to images for demo.
