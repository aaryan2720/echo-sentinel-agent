# üé¨ Media Viewer Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ How to Test the Media Evidence Viewer

### Quick Test (Right Now):

1. **Make sure dev server is running**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the app**: http://localhost:5173 (or whatever port Vite shows)

3. **Navigate**: Click "Incidents" in the navigation

4. **Test Each Media Type**:

   **A) Video Test** (Incident #1):
   - Click "View Evidence" on "Political Deepfake Video Campaign"
   - You should see a video player
   - Click the ‚ñ∂ Play button
   - Video should play (10 second Big Buck Bunny clip)
   - At 1.5s, 4.2s, 7.8s you should see detection overlays appear
   - Try seeking with the slider
   - Try changing playback speed to 0.5x

   **B) Audio Test** (Incident #2):
   - Click "View Evidence" on "Audio Clone Impersonation"
   - You should see a waveform
   - Click the ‚ñ∂ Play button  
   - Music should play and waveform should progress
   - See audio anomalies listed below

   **C) Image Test** (Incident #3):
   - Click "View Evidence" on "Coordinated Meme Manipulation"
   - You should see an image with a slider
   - Drag the slider left/right to compare

## üêõ If Video/Audio Don't Load:

### Problem: "Video won't play"
**Possible Causes**:
1. **CORS issue** - External URLs blocked
2. **Network issue** - Firewall/proxy blocking
3. **Format issue** - Browser doesn't support codec

**Solution**:
Download a test video and use it locally:

```bash
# From public/samples/ folder, download a test video:
# Visit: https://test-videos.co.uk/vids/bigbuckbunny/mp4/h264/360/Big_Buck_Bunny_360_10s_1MB.mp4
# Save as: public/samples/test-video.mp4
```

Then update the incident mediaUrl to:
```typescript
mediaUrl: "/samples/test-video.mp4"
```

- [x] Tabs switch (Player/Detections/Metadata)

### ‚úÖ Audio Player:
- [x] Waveform renders
- [x] Play/Pause works
- [x] Progress shows on waveform
- [x] Can click waveform to seek
- [x] Audio anomalies list shows
- [x] Clicking anomaly jumps to timestamp

### ‚úÖ Image Viewer:

## üîç Debug Checklist:

**If nothing is working**:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12):
   - Look for errors (red text)
   - Look for CORS errors
   - Look for 404 errors (file not found)

2. **Check Network Tab** (F12 ‚Üí Network):
   - Click "View Evidence"
   - See if media file is loading
   - Check HTTP status (should be 200)

3. **Try Different Browser**:
   - Chrome/Edge (best support)
   - Firefox (good support)  
   - Safari (might have issues)

4. **Check Internet Connection**:
   - External URLs need internet
   - Try: https://test-videos.co.uk/vids/bigbuckbunny/mp4/h264/360/Big_Buck_Bunny_360_10s_1MB.mp4
   - Should download a video file

## üí° Quick Fixes:

### Fix 1: Use Local Files
Download test media and put in `public/samples/`:
- `test-video.mp4` - Any short MP4 video
- `test-audio.mp3` - Any MP3 file
- `test-image.jpg` - Any JPEG image

Then change URLs to:
```typescript
mediaUrl: "/samples/test-video.mp4"
```

### Fix 2: Use Data URLs
For images, you can use base64:
```typescript
mediaUrl: "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ..."
```

### Fix 3: Test with Browser Samples
Some browsers have built-in test videos:
```typescript
mediaUrl: "https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4"
```

## üì∏ Expected Results:

### When Working Correctly:

**Video Player**:
```
[Video showing bunny in black player]
[Control bar at bottom with ‚ñ∂ button]
[Timeline with red markers at 1.5s, 4.2s, 7.8s]
[Speed: 1x] [Volume icon]
```

**During Playback**:
```
At 1.5s: [Red alert box] "Facial region shows deep learning manipulation artifacts" [96% confident]
```

**Audio Player**:
