## 🎯 How to Test

### Test Image Analysis

1. **Click "Try Sample Image"** button
   - Uses a real image from Unsplash
   - First request takes ~20-30 seconds (model loading)
   - Watch the logs for progress!

2. **Or enter your own URL**:
   ```

   ```
   - Click "Analyze Image"
   - Wait for results

3. **See Results**:
   - 🔴 FAKE badge (red) = Deepfake detected
   - 🟢 REAL badge (green) = Real image
   - 🟡 UNCERTAIN badge (yellow) = Inconclusive
   - Confidence score (0-100%)
   - Processing time
   - Detected artifacts (if fake)

## ⏱️ Performance Expectations

| Test | First Request | Subsequent Requests |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Image** | 20-30 seconds | 2-5 seconds |
| **Video (10s)** | 30-60 seconds | 15-30 seconds |
| **Video (30s)** | 60-150 seconds | 30-90 seconds |

**Why is first request slow?**
- Hugging Face needs to load the model into memory
- Only happens once per session
- After that, it's cached and fast! ✨

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

**Before Testing**:
- [x] API key added to `.env`
- [x] Dev server running
- [x] Browser opened to `/visual-test`

**During Test**:
- [ ] Agent status shows "RUNNING" (green badge)
- [ ] Click "Try Sample Image"
- [ ] See logs updating in real-time
- [ ] Wait 20-30 seconds for first result
- [ ] Result card appears with verdict
- [ ] Confidence score displayed
- [ ] Processing time shown

**Test Passed If**:
- ✅ No errors in logs
- ✅ Result card appears
- ✅ Verdict is FAKE or REAL or UNCERTAIN
- ✅ Confidence between 0-100%
- ✅ Second image analyzes faster (2-5s)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Agent shows "ERROR" status

**Problem**: API key not loaded  
**Fix**: 
1. Check `.env` file has `VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_...`
2. Restart dev server
3. Refresh browser

### "Analysis timeout (60s)"

**Problem**: Model taking too long to load  
**Fix**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try again (model might be cold starting)
3. Check Hugging Face status: https://status.huggingface.co

### "Failed to fetch image"

**Problem**: Image URL not accessible  
**Fix**:
1. Make sure URL is publicly accessible
2. Try the sample image button
3. Use a different image URL

### No results appear

**Problem**: Task stuck in queue  
**Fix**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Stop and restart agent
3. Try a different image

## 🎓 Understanding the Results

### Verdict Meanings

**🔴 FAKE** (Deepfake Detected)
- Model confidence >70% that image is manipulated
- Artifacts detected in image
- Could be AI-generated, face-swapped, or edited

**🟢 REAL** (Authentic)
- Model confidence >70% that image is real
- No manipulation artifacts detected
- Likely authentic photo

**🟡 UNCERTAIN** (Inconclusive)
- Model confidence 50-70%
- Some indicators of manipulation
- Needs human review

### Confidence Score

- **90-100%**: Very high confidence
- **70-90%**: High confidence
- **50-70%**: Medium confidence (uncertain)
- **0-50%**: Low confidence

### Artifacts

Examples of detected artifacts:
- "Strong synthetic patterns detected"
- "Face manipulation indicators"
- "Possible deepfake artifacts"

These indicate **what** the model detected as suspicious.
