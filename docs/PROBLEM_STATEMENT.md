# EchoBreaker — Problem Statement

## Title
**Detecting and Disrupting Coordinated Deepfake & Propaganda Operations with an Agentic AI**

## Context & Motivation

Digital platforms allow information to spread instantly. Adversaries exploit this by producing and coordinating large volumes of deceptive content — deepfake videos, doctored audio, manipulated images, and meme networks — and using coordinated account clusters (bots, sock-puppets, shady channels) to amplify narratives.

During crises (health, elections, conflicts) these coordinated operations produce outsized social harm: fear, violence, suppression of facts, electoral interference, or economic manipulation.

**The Core Problem:** Traditional fact-checking models examine individual claims after virality; platform moderation often reacts slowly, and most methods don't detect **networked coordination** (how separate nodes behave together to amplify a target).

## Problem Statement (Executive Summary)

Build **EchoBreaker** — an agentic, multimodal AI system that autonomously scans streams of social content (video, audio, images, text), detects deepfakes and synthetic media, maps the propagation graph to identify coordinated influence campaigns, assigns credibility/trust scores to narratives, and produces actionable, evidence-backed reports and alerts that can be consumed by media houses, fact-checkers, and public agencies.

The system must go beyond single-post verification: it must detect *coordinated* campaigns, identify clusters and their tactics (timing, amplification signatures, reused assets), and offer structured outputs (heatmaps, network graphs, incident reports, snippets for debunking) while preserving privacy, explainability, and scalability.

## Key Challenges to Solve

1. **Reliable multimodal deepfake detection at scale** (video + audio + image + text)
2. **Network-level detection**: clustering accounts/actors by coordinated behavior, not just similarity of content
3. **Real-time ingestion at social-scale** (trending topics, spikes)
4. **Explainability and forensics**: produce human-legible evidence (timestamps, content provenance, similarity scores) so journalists and moderators can act
5. **Low false-positive rates** (so media trust the system) and a clear human-in-the-loop workflow for verification
6. **Ethical/privacy constraints**, localization (Indian languages & region-specific channels), and adversarial robustness (attackers adapting)

## Stakeholders & Users

- **Journalists & newsrooms** — rapid alerts + evidence to investigate
- **Fact-checking organizations** — structured incident dossiers
- **Social media platforms & safety teams** — signal for priority moderation
- **Election authorities & public safety agencies** — situational awareness
- **General public** — dashboard & digest (optional)

## Outcome / Impact Goal

Early detection and disruption of misinformation operations, reducing harm and enabling faster, evidence-backed reporting. Provide a defensible, auditable signal that media and platforms can use to prioritize human review and public corrections.

## Why This Matters for Mumbai Hacks 2025

This project addresses one of the most critical challenges of our digital age — the weaponization of AI-generated content for mass manipulation. During Mumbai's recent civic issues and India's election cycles, coordinated misinformation has proven to be a significant threat. EchoBreaker aims to be the first line of defense, enabling rapid response before narratives spiral out of control.
