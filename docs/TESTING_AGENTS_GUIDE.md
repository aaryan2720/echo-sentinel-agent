## 🎯 What You'll Test

The **Agent Test Lab** lets you interact with the BaseAgent framework and AgentHub in real-time. You'll see:

1. **Agent Creation** - Watch 3 test agents initialize and start
2. **Task Queue** - See priority-based task processing
3. **Load Balancing** - Observe AgentHub routing tasks
4. **Real-Time Metrics** - Monitor agent performance
5. **System Health** - View overall system status
6. **Message Passing** - Track inter-agent communication

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Open the Test Page

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/agent-test
```

### Step 2: Run the Full Test

1. Click the **"Run Full Test"** button
2. Watch the test logs in real-time
3. Observe agents processing tasks
4. View final metrics

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ 3 agents created (Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
- ✅ All agents start successfully
- ✅ 5 tasks added to queues
- ✅ Tasks processed by priority (10 → 8 → 5 → 3 → 1)
- ✅ All tasks complete successfully
- ✅ Metrics show processing times

---

## 📊 What Each Section Shows

### 1. Control Panel
- **Run Full Test**: Executes the complete test suite
- **Stop All Agents**: Gracefully stops all running agents
- **Clear Logs**: Resets the test log display

### 2. System Health Dashboard

Live metrics updated every second:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Agents** | Number of registered agents |
| **Active** | Agents ready to work (not in error state) |
| **Idle** | Agents waiting for tasks |
| **Processing** | Agents currently working |
| **Errors** | Agents in error state |
| **Queued Tasks** | Total tasks waiting across all agents |

**What to Look For**:
- Active agents should match total agents
- Processing count changes as tasks are worked on
- Queued tasks decrease to 0 as test completes

### 3. Test Agents Panel

Shows each agent's status:

**Agent Cards Display**:
- **Name**: Test Agent Alpha, Beta, Gamma
- **Status Badge**: 
  - 🟢 `idle` = Ready for work
  - ⚡ `processing` = Currently working (animated pulse)
  - 🔴 `error` = Something failed
- **Queue**: Number of tasks waiting
- **Tasks**: Total tasks processed
- **Success**: Successfully completed tasks
- **Failed**: Tasks that encountered errors
- **Avg Time**: Average processing time in milliseconds

**What to Look For**:
- All agents start with status `idle`
- Status changes to `processing` when working
- Queue lengths vary based on load balancing
- Success rate should be 100%
- Average time around 1000-3000ms

### 4. Test Logs

Real-time console showing test execution:

**Log Colors**:
- 🟢 **Green** (✅): Success messages
- 🔴 **Red** (❌): Errors
- 🟡 **Yellow** (⏳): In-progress operations

### 5. AgentHub Messages

Shows inter-agent communication:

**Message Types**:
- `agent_registered`: Agent joined the hub
- `agent_unregistered`: Agent left the hub
- `task_added`: New task queued
- `task_completed`: Task finished
- Custom messages from agent workflows

**What to Look For**:
- Messages appear as agents are registered
- Communication happens in real-time
- From/To shows message routing

## 🔍 Detailed Test Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Agent Creation (0-2 seconds)

**What Happens**:
1. 3 TestAgent instances created with different configurations:
   - **Alpha**: Max 2 concurrent tasks
   - **Beta**: Max 3 concurrent tasks
   - **Gamma**: Max 1 concurrent task

2. Each agent:
   - Calls `initialize()` to connect to database
   - Registers with AgentHub
   - Calls `start()` to begin processing loop

**Visual Indicators**:
- System Health shows "Total Agents: 3"
- All 3 agent cards appear
- Status badges show "idle" (green)
- Logs show "✅ All agents created and started!"

### Phase 2: Task Addition (2-3 seconds)

**What Happens**:
5 tasks added with different priorities:
1. Priority 10 → `analyze_image` (High)
2. Priority 5 → `analyze_video` (Medium)
3. Priority 1 → `analyze_audio` (Low)
4. Priority 8 → `detect_network` (High)
5. Priority 3 → `verify_content` (Low)

**Load Balancing**:
- AgentHub distributes tasks to agents with smallest queues
- Higher priority tasks processed first
- Multiple agents work in parallel

**Visual Indicators**:
- Agent queue counts increase
- System Health shows "Queued Tasks: 5"
- Agent status changes to "processing"
- Status badges pulse (animated)

### Phase 3: Task Processing (3-10 seconds)

**What Happens**:
- Agents process tasks in priority order
- Each task takes 1-3 seconds (simulated work)
- Automatic retry on failures (max 3 attempts)
- Metrics updated in real-time

**Visual Indicators**:
- Queue counts decrease
- "Tasks" counter increases
- "Success" counter increases
- "Processing" count fluctuates
- Average time calculated

### Phase 4: Completion (10+ seconds)

**What Happens**:
- All queues reach 0
- All agents return to "idle" status
- Final metrics calculated and displayed
- Test marked as complete

**Visual Indicators**:
- System Health: "Queued Tasks: 0"
- System Health: "Processing: 0"
- All agents show "idle" status
- Logs show "🎉 Test Complete!"

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### ✅ Test Passes If:

1. **All Agents Start**
   - 3 agents created successfully
   - All show "idle" status
   - No error badges

2. **Tasks Are Queued**
   - 5 tasks added
   - Queue lengths increase
   - System health shows total

3. **Tasks Process**
   - Agents change to "processing"
   - Queue counts decrease
   - Tasks completed count increases

4. **All Tasks Complete**
   - Final queued tasks = 0
   - No failed tasks
   - All agents back to "idle"

5. **Metrics Are Accurate**
   - Tasks processed = 5 total
   - Tasks succeeded = 5
   - Tasks failed = 0
   - Average time > 0ms

6. **No Errors**
   - No red error badges
   - No ❌ in logs
   - System health: "Errors: 0"

### ❌ Test Fails If:

- Agents fail to initialize
- Tasks don't process
- Error badges appear
- Failed task count > 0
- Test hangs/doesn't complete

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No agents running" message

**Cause**: Agents haven't been created yet  
**Fix**: Click "Run Full Test" button

### Issue: Agents stuck in "processing"

**Cause**: Task taking longer than expected  
**Fix**: Wait up to 10 seconds. If still stuck, click "Stop All Agents" and retry

### Issue: Tasks failed

**Cause**: Simulated error or timeout  
**Fix**: Normal behavior if retry count exceeded. Check logs for details

### Issue: Test doesn't complete

**Cause**: Agent may have crashed  
**Fix**: 
1. Click "Stop All Agents"
2. Click "Clear Logs"
3. Refresh page
4. Run test again

### Issue: TypeScript errors in console

**Cause**: Missing dependencies or compilation issue  
**Fix**: 
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧠 Understanding the Code

### How Agents Work

```typescript
// Create agent
const agent = new TestAgent(config);

// Initialize (connect to DB, setup)
await agent.initialize();

// Start processing loop
await agent.start();

// Add task to queue
await agent.addTask('task_type', data, priority);

// Agent processes task automatically
// Calls processTask() method internally

// Stop agent
await agent.stop();
```

### How AgentHub Works

```typescript
// Get hub instance (singleton)
const hub = AgentHub.getInstance();

// Register agent
hub.registerAgent(agent);

// Route task to best agent
await hub.routeTask('test', 'analyze', data, priority);

// Get system health
const health = hub.getSystemHealth();

// Subscribe to messages
hub.subscribe('task_complete', (msg) => {
  console.log('Task done:', msg.payload);
});
```

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Normal Behavior

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Agent startup time | < 1 second |
| Task processing time | 1-3 seconds each |
| Total test duration | 8-12 seconds |
| Success rate | 100% |
| Failed tasks | 0 |
| System health update | Every 1 second |

### If Performance Differs

**Slower than expected**:
- Normal on first run (cold start)
- Database connection latency
- System load

**Faster than expected**:
- Tasks might not be simulating work
- Check that delays are working
