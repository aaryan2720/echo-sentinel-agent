## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Issue: "I see a black box, no video"
**Causes**:
1. Video is still loading (wait 5-10 seconds)
2. Your network is blocking the URL
3. CORS issue

**Fix**:
- Open Browser Console (F12)
- Look for errors
- Check Network tab to see if video is downloading

### Issue: "Video loads but won't play"
**Causes**:
1. Browser autoplay policy (videos must be muted to autoplay)
2. Codec not supported

**Fix**:
- Try clicking the play button
- Try clicking on the video itself
- Check if volume is muted

### Issue: "Dialog doesn't open"
**Cause**: JavaScript error

**Fix**:
- Check browser console (F12)
- Look for red errors
- Share the error message with me

### Issue: "Audio waveform doesn't show"
**Cause**: WaveSurfer.js loading issue

**Fix**:
- Wait a few seconds for it to load
- Check console for errors
- May need internet connection
