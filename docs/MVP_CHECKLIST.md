## Emergency Shortcuts (If Behind Schedule)

### Backend Shortcuts
1. Use JSON files instead of database (faster)
2. Skip WebSocket, use polling instead
3. Use pre-computed analysis results (no ML)
4. Mock all external API calls

### Frontend Shortcuts
1. Use static graph instead of interactive
2. Show embedded PDFs instead of generating
3. Use sample videos instead of upload
4. Hardcode demo data in components

### Feature Cuts (Last Resort)
1. Skip audio analysis
2. Skip analytics page
3. Skip settings functionality
4. Reduce to 2 demo scenarios
5. Use screenshots instead of live demo

- [ ] Deploy backend to Railway/Render
- [ ] Share GitHub repository link
- [ ] Post demo video on YouTube
- [ ] Update LinkedIn/Twitter with project
- [ ] Submit to Devfolio with all materials
- [ ] Follow up with judges (if contacts provided)

## Team Roles (Recommended)

If working with 2-3 people:

**Developer 1 (Backend)**
- FastAPI setup
- Database models
- API endpoints
- WebSocket implementation

**Developer 2 (Frontend/Full-stack)**
- Frontend-backend integration
- UI components enhancement
- PDF generation
- Interactive visualizations

**Developer 3 (AI/ML + Demo)** [Optional]
- Detection service integration
- Demo scenario creation
- Data seeding
- Testing & QA

---

## Final Notes

- **Prioritize working features over perfect code**
- **Test frequently, don't wait until the end**
- **Keep demo simple and clear**
- **Have backup plans for everything**
- **Sleep at least 4-5 hours each night** (you'll code better)

**Remember**: Judges care about:
1. Does it work?
2. Does it solve a real problem?
3. Is it technically impressive?
4. Can it scale post-hackathon?

Your UI already nails #2, #3, and #4. Now just make it work! ðŸš€
