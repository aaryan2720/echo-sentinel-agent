## üé§ Your Pitch (Practice This)

> "Echo Sentinel uses AI to detect coordinated deepfake campaigns across social media. 
> 
> We monitor platforms like Twitter and Telegram in real-time, analyze images and videos using state-of-the-art deep learning models, and identify bot networks spreading fake content.
> 
> Our customers are journalists, fact-checkers, and organizations who need to verify content before it goes viral.
> 
> Unlike generic deepfake detectors, we focus on **coordinated campaigns** - where multiple fake accounts spread the same manipulated content to create false narratives.
> 
> We're currently in beta with working image analysis and building out social media integrations. Our goal is to be the standard tool for fighting misinformation campaigns."

**30 seconds. Practice until smooth.**

## üí™ Mindset Shifts

### ‚ùå Hackathon Mindset
- Build fast, break things
- Demo over functionality
- Shortcuts everywhere
- "Good enough for judges"

### ‚úÖ Production Mindset
- Build right, test thoroughly
- Functionality over flashiness
- Proper architecture
- "Good enough for paying users"

### Key Principles
1. **Quality > Speed**: Better to ship late and stable than early and broken
2. **Users > Features**: One working feature beats 10 broken ones
3. **Revenue > Growth**: 10 paying users > 1,000 free users
4. **Focus > Breadth**: Perfect core before adding extras
5. **Docs > Code**: If it's not documented, it doesn't exist

---

## üö® Common Pitfalls (Avoid These!)

### 1. Feature Creep
**Mistake**: Adding "just one more feature" before launch  
**Solution**: Ship MVP, iterate based on user feedback

### 2. Perfectionism
**Mistake**: Waiting until everything is perfect  
**Solution**: 80% quality, 100% working is enough for beta

### 3. Building Alone
**Mistake**: Not getting feedback until launch  
**Solution**: Show work-in-progress, ask for input

### 4. Ignoring Users
**Mistake**: Building what YOU think users need  
**Solution**: Talk to 10 potential users, build what THEY need

### 5. Analysis Paralysis
**Mistake**: Spending weeks planning, not coding  
**Solution**: Plan for 1 day, code for 6 days, repeat
