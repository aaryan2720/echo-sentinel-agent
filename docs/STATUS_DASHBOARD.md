## 🚀 Quick Wins (Do First)

### Quick Win #1: Backend API (6 hours)
```python
# main.py (FastAPI)
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/api/incidents")
def get_incidents():
    return [...]  # Return mock data

@app.post("/api/analyze")
def analyze_media(file: UploadFile):
    return {"confidence": 94, "threat": "high"}
```

### Quick Win #2: Connect Frontend (2 hours)
```typescript
// src/services/api.ts
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'

export async function getIncidents() {
  const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/incidents`)
  return res.json()
}
```

### Quick Win #3: Demo Scenario (3 hours)
- Prepare sample deepfake video
- Create fake network data
- Seed database
- Test upload → analysis → report flow

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Risk #1: Backend not ready in time
**Mitigation**: Use JSON files instead of database (faster)

### Risk #2: Detection models don't work
**Mitigation**: Use pre-computed results (fake real-time)

### Risk #3: Demo crashes during presentation
**Mitigation**: Record backup video + have screenshots ready

### Risk #4: Technical questions stump team
**Mitigation**: Study architecture, prepare FAQ answers
