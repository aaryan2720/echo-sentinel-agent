## 🎤 Your Elevator Pitch

> **"Echo Sentinel uses AI to detect and combat coordinated deepfake campaigns across social media.**
> 
> **We monitor platforms in real-time, analyze media using deep learning, and identify bot networks spreading fake content.**
> 
> **Unlike generic deepfake detectors, we focus on coordinated campaigns - the real threat to elections and public discourse.**
> 
> **We're in beta with working AI and building social media integrations. Our goal: become the standard tool for fighting misinformation."**

**30 seconds. Know it by heart.**

## 💪 Mindset Shifts

### Before (Hackathon)
- "Make it look good for demo"
- "Shortcuts are fine"
- "Features > functionality"
- "Judges need to be impressed"

### After (Production)
- "Make it work perfectly"
- "Do it right the first time"
- "Functionality > features"
- "Users need to love it"

---

## 🚨 Rules of the Road

### 1. Quality First
- Better to ship late and stable than early and broken
- Write tests for everything
- Document as you code

### 2. Users First
- Talk to 10 potential users this month
- Build what they need, not what you think is cool
- Get feedback every week

### 3. Focus First
- One feature at a time
- Finish before starting new work
- Perfect core before adding extras

### 4. Ship First
- Done is better than perfect
- 80% quality is enough for beta
- Iterate based on real usage

### 5. Measure First
- Track key metrics weekly
- Make data-driven decisions
- Know your numbers
